South Africa’s minister of mineral resources, Gwede Mantashe,  has sounded a warning about the consequences of impending retrenchments in the mining sector. The minister said this in the wake of the retrenchments that Impala Platinum Mines and Gold Fields have announced that they are likely to carry out. Mantashe accused mining companies of not being committed to discussing matters meaningfully in the interest of sustaining the sector and the economy. On how to manage their current situation, the minister suggested: “Instead of retrenching workers, mining companies should seeks ways on how to optimise production.” If Goldfields and Impala go ahead with their plans to shed their staff, in the next two years, over 15 000 will be added to the unemployment statistics.
