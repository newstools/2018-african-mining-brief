More than 90% of South Africa’s electricity produced by Eskom is currently generated from coal. Eskom is currently building two significant coal power stations, Kusile and Medupi, which are expected to come online fully by 2022. The report says Eskom’s coal costs have increased by 300% in real terms over the past 20 years, while demand for electricity has been dropping. The study also argues that new renewable energy capacity is now considerably cheaper than either the new Eskom coal-fired power plants that are currently under construction, or the privately-owned coal plants proposed in the IRP 2018 that has recently been released for comment, UCT says. “By 2050, in the power sector only Medupi and Kusile are still running, and coal makes up only 11% of electricity supply,” notes the report. Government this year signed contracts worth R56bn (US$3.65 bn) with independent renewable energy producers, as part of adding clean energy to the country’s energy mix. Labour unions are fiercely opposed to the renewable energy contracts, arguing that the system is too costly and would lead to the shutting down of coal mines. The report outlines various coal transition scenarios for the country and notes that by 2050, employment in coal mining could decrease by 28 200 workers, relative to 78 000 workers in 2015.
