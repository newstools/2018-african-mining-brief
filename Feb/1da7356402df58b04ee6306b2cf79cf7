Mine closures are more complicated and costly than stakeholders ever realise. South Africa has more than 6000 abandoned mines. Major mines often sell their assets to junior miners who don’t have the resources to close successfully. All mining companies will need to be aware of coming new environmental legislation (which will replace the NEMA financial regulations). This will fundamentally change how mining companies need to plan for closure and will increase their closure liability. It may, also, however create a business opportunity (i.e. The eMalahleni Recycling Water Project). Water scarcity will have a massive effect on individual and businesses – but this issue creates a business opportunity – especially for the mining sector. Proof points:
