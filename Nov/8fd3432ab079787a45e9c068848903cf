By Jane Justine Mirembe Security agencies have arrested a syndicate of Ugandan, Congolese and Cameroonian fake gold dealers for allegedly conning a Chinese investor. Mr Star Yang, a Chinese national, was lured to travel to Uganda with the prospect of buying gold. Upon reaching in Uganda, he was linked to one of the suspects, a 40-year-old residing in Kabowa, Rubaga Division in Kampala District who said he had a company which deals in gold. It’s reported that Mr Yang was shown two genuine gold bars which were subjected to test and was then asked to deposit 83000 US Dollars and return on the following week to pick up the would-be-ready gold bar consignment. “On failure to provide the investor with the agreed gold bars, he then sought for assistance from authorities and a theft report was filed against them alleging he was defrauded of 100000 US Dollars,” Kampala Metropolitan Police wrote on their Facebook timeline. Upon search at their premises, suspects were found in illegal possession of G4S Private Security organisation uniforms, 100 kilograms of suspected fake gold, weighing scales and gold testing machines. The gold samples are to be taken to the Government Analytical Laboratory for testing and suspects would be charged with theft if found guilty. The suspects are currently detained at Kabalagala Police Station pending arraignment in courts of law.
